The IPM Utility
===============

A simple utility, which computes the inverse
of the probability that any two arbitrarily chosen characters
in the specified input file match.

This utility is Unicode-aware, which means that
it understands all the character encodings supported by the iconv
and it can read the input file on character-by-character basis
instead of standard byte-by-byte basis.

This application provides a single executable:
ipm	computes the inverse probability of matching
	for the given input file

Requirements:
-------------

For compiling:

C++ compiler and libraries at least partially conforming
to the 2011 ISO C++ standard (C++11), because of:
	- the type unsigned long long

and also at least partially conforming to the POSIX.1-2001 standard,
because of:
	- function iconv and related stuff
	- function getopt and related stuff

Compilation:
------------

It should be as easy as:

make

Usage:
------

Run the compiled executable without any parameters
and follow the provided instructions.
